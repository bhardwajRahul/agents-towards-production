# 🔁 Durable RAG Ingestion with Inngest

Build a document ingestion pipeline that **survives partial failures, re-runs and backfills**.

Most RAG tutorials assume your documents made it into the index. This one is about what happens
when they do not: a run over thousands of documents that dies two thirds of the way through, and a
retry that re-parses and re-embeds everything it already paid for.

Every number in that chart comes from section 4 of the notebook, which you can run with no API key
and no account.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **What Inngest actually is**, from the events-functions-steps model up, in section 6. No prior
  knowledge of it assumed
- **What a failed run actually costs.** You run the naive pipeline, kill it at document 3,000 of
  5,000, retry it, and count the wasted embedding calls and the duplicate chunks yourself
- **Durable steps**: wrapping each stage in `step.run()` so a retry resumes at the document that
  failed instead of at document one
- **Idempotent upserts** keyed on document ID plus content hash, so re-ingesting the same file
  updates in place rather than adding a second copy
- **Fan-out per document**, so one unparseable file fails on its own instead of taking the run down,
  and when `step.invoke` is the better tool than an event
- **Flow control**: throttling and per-tenant concurrency, so a historical backfill does not starve
  live ingestion
- **A human review gate** with `step.wait_for_event()` for documents that fail parsing
- **When you do not need any of this**, which is a real answer for a lot of pipelines

## 📓 Tutorial

[durable_rag_ingestion_tutorial.ipynb](durable_rag_ingestion_tutorial.ipynb)

## 🚀 Run in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production/blob/main/tutorials/durable-rag-ingestion-inngest/durable_rag_ingestion_tutorial.ipynb)

Sections 1 to 5 run anywhere, Colab included, with no API key and no account. They are the part
that shows the cost. Sections 7 onward run the real pipeline and need the local Inngest dev server,
which is a single command and also free.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **No API key.** Embeddings are a deterministic local stand-in so the numbers are reproducible and
  nobody has to pay to read a tutorial. Swapping in a real embedding model is one function.
- **Node.js**, only for sections 7 onward, to run `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🎓 What You'll Build

An ingestion pipeline that fetches, parses, chunks, embeds and upserts a 5,000 document corpus,
and then keeps its place when things go wrong:

- A failure at document 3,000 costs you the remaining 2,000, not all 5,000
- Re-running the whole pipeline over an unchanged corpus adds zero duplicate chunks
- One malformed document fails alone and lands in a review queue
- A backfill runs at a throttled rate without starving live ingestion
- You fix a parser bug and replay one step against one document

**Total Tutorial Time**: ~45 minutes
**Difficulty**: Intermediate (Python, basic RAG concepts, no prior Inngest knowledge assumed)
